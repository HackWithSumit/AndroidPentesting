<b><h2>Local Data Storage Enumeration</b></h2>

In order to enumerate the file structure of an installed application, we need to have access to a real or emulated device. This could be achieved by using the Android Debug Bridge (ADB), a command-line tool that lets you communicate directly with the device. Using ADB, we can install and debug applications, while the Unix shell it provides can be used to run commands on the device.

<b><h2>Connecting via ADB</b></h2>

Enable the USB Debugging option on the device

Settings, then About Device or About Phone, depending on the device, and then we scroll down and tap on the Build Number seven times until the message “You are now a developer!” pops up.

Next, tap the back button one time and navigate to Developer Options.
